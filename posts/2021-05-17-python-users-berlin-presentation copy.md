Last week I had the honor of giving a talk at Python Users Berlin. In the talk I went over the new "Pattern Matching" feature set to be released in Python 3.10 later this year. If you want to learn more about this new feature head over to [PEP 636](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0636/) to get a demo and feel free to [check out my slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18Wfpjz3-MKL1GMQ6IYvhyZH3kq_YqbjEKcKl9URMwoc/edit?usp=sharing) for some more examples.

A big thank you once again to the meet up organizers for letting me come and speak. I'm looking forward to more upcoming Python talks at Python Users Berlin!
