## Research Projects

<hr />

### Master Thesis: "Mapping Alternative Mobility Accessibility in Kiel: The Argument for Auto-reduction Strategies"

In this project, I developed a walkability of index and used it to plan various auto-reduction measures for the city of Kiel. GIS was used heavily in this project, and much of the code I wrote for it is now open source (available here: https://github.com/travishathaway/altmo). The project also has a companion website which presents the results of my findings.

### Urban Heat Island Research

As a technical assistant, my primary role was helping develop remote sensing hardware for the collection temperature and GPS data. The early prototypes I developed eventually led to the development of production units. Additionally, I was in charge of developing a web application for the management of the data that we collected. Although this web application prototype never led to primary usage, lessons learned during its development informed future decisions regarding data management.
