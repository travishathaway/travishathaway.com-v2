Earlier this week, I had the chance to present at the [Python Users Berlin](http://www.meetup.com/Python-Users-Berlin-PUB/) group. This time, I presented on how to use the [asyncio module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html). I recently wrote my first program using Python's async features and was happy to share my experiences and help others learn how to do it too.

Below are links to my slides and also to a GitHub repository I created with some examples of async programming:

 ## Extra announcement

I am happy to announce that this year I will be presenting at [PyConDE 2022](https://2022.pycon.de/). It should be a fun a experience, and I am looking forward to meeting some new people in the Python community.  The talk itself will cover using Python and PostgreSQL to analyze data from the OpenStreetMap database. More information about my talk can be found here: [https://2022.pycon.de/program/AKCLEP/](https://2022.pycon.de/program/AKCLEP/).

As the talk nears (middle of April), I will most likely prepare a written version of the talk and post it here.
