Earlier this year a friend of mine ([6RAJ](https://soundcloud.com/6RAJ)) invited me to [Amsterdam Dance Event](https://www.amsterdam-dance-event.nl/en/live/) (ADE) that happens every year in Amsterdam. I love Amsterdam, and I love dancing, so obviously this sounded like a lot of fun! ADE isn't just one event though: it's hundreds of events spread throughout the city over several days. So, how was I going stay organized and figure out all the acts I wanted to go see? Unfortunately the official app offered by ADE isn't good enough to organize, search and bookmark all the events I wanted to go to, so I decided to roll my own. In this post, I'll talk about how I did that, how I used LLMs for the first time in a hobby project and most importantly, whether this thing I built actually helped me organize my trip better (unfortunately the app did not help me dance better 😛).

## Why bother?

As someone who builds software for a living, I always welcome opportunities where I can become the guinea pig myself. That's the primary reason I was so excited to build this particular tool: I knew I was going to immediately use it at the event itself and get a good feedback loop on the user experience. I also wanted to give "vibe coding" a try. By "vibe coding", I mean using Claude Code as an assistant during the process to help me write everything.

Everything I've done can found in this repository:
