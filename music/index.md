This is a semi-organized splattering of the music I have created over the years. I have attempted to organize the songs by project name (when there is one) as well as give a brief overview of when I wrote it and whatever other details I wish to indulge in. You can find a lot of this stuff over on my [Sound Cloud](https://soundcloud.com/travis-hathaway) account too, but there are some things here which are not available there.

## [Masters of Revolution](masters-of-revolution)

Kind of a gothic metal project, I started this in about 2016. To date, I have written and recorded four songs for it (just enough for a demo).

## [Enkindled Bonds](enkindled-bonds)

This was my very first project. It was mostly just thrash metal recorded with really bad sounding drum machines.
