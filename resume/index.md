## Research Projects
<hr />

### University Green Space

In this research project, which was carried out at Christian-Albrechts University, we set out to answer how best to redevelop an abandoned lot on university grounds. Our group worked closely with university administration to come up with a set of suggestions for the space.

My primary role was developing a website for our project which allowed us to host surveys, publish information concerning the project and share additional blog style content. I also helped conduct interviews and helped co-host a workshop where we further distilled key recommendations for the space.

This project was also conducted throughout the Corona pandemic and required our group to quickly adapt our methodologies.

### Urban Heat Island

As a technical assistant, my primary role was helping develop remote sensing hardware for the collection temperature and GPS data. The early prototypes I developed eventually led to the development of production units. Additionally, I was in charge of developing a web application for the management of the data that we collected. Although this web application prototype never led to primary usage, lessons learned during its development informed future decisions regarding data management.
